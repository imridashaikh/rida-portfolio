    I like uploding vlogs on my youtube you can go check that out too.I basically make videos
    about places and drawings too, yes I am a fan of drawing m not that good but yeah i love it.
    I have made many drawings till now, I have alot of folders of drawings. I belive if I practise more I can make wonderfull artpices.
    Till now i have learned basic shading and I can draw basic things which are not detailed. I have made many flowers since i love them. Recently I discovered my love for drawing butterflies I love how detailed and pretty they are ,they made me realise that nature is so pretty and I feel like drawing more of natures beauty I also like drawing music in my head I know this topic is different but I am gonna try making them on papper and see how appreciable it can be. Yes I love music too.

haha yes dancing and skateboarding are two of my hobbies if you remeber I did mention that I lilked art so art is also one of my hobbies
I have been dancing since I was 3 years old that clip was very small I know but I dont have anyother clips. When m dancing I feel happy its like a small break from homework or work 
also moving ur body time to time makes you a bit energetic and not lazy ,so a little advice keep moving ur body..Skateboarding i just started to learn and its very very fun
although i fell a few times scrapped my knees and couldnt walk properly for a week for now i dont know any tricks but I do know how to make circles turns and stopping my board.
